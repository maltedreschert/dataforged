  "Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Name_Template#Description": "To generate a faction name, first roll or choose the name template. Then, follow the structure of the template to build the name from individual tables. If you’ve already set the faction type, picking from the tables (instead of rolling) will likely provide a more appropriate result. For example, “Silver Jackals” is a fitting name for a criminal organization. The “Empire of the Undying Suns” is a less apt name for that gang—unless their leader is prone to delusions of grandeur. In short, choosing a name will give you more control. Rolling might give you a result that doesn’t square with known aspects, but those contradictions may prove inspiring.\n\nAn alternative approach to generating a faction from scratch is to start with a random name. Then, consider what the name evokes and choose an appropriate faction type instead of rolling on those tables. For example, “Bloody Ravens” might suggest a mercenary guild, while the “Republic of the Radiant Servants” brings to mind a dominion built upon a religion, or one that idolizes a prophesied leader. If a result doesn’t inspire anything interesting, roll again or pick.",

Or pair a theme with other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might explore a **Haunted Grave World**, a **Ruined Derelict**, a **Sacred Precursor Vault**, or an **Inhabited Settlement**.\n\nWhen mixing-and-matching a theme with another set of tables, use the techniques described for an **oracle array** (page 384) to determine which oracle you reference for that question or phase of your exploration.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Iron/68-100#Description": "Aboard a starship, where stray gunfire can destroy fragile equipment or pierce hulls, the brutal practicality of a sword makes for a useful weapon. A few also favor the silent efficiency of a blade for infiltration or espionage. Most importantly, when the Ironsworn swear a vow upon a sword, they bind their commitment to the metal. If they forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be Ironsworn without a blade is to be disgraced.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Laws/1-33#Description": "Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Laws/1-33#Quest_Starter": "In the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, transport vehicles carry valuable and volatile fuel from the processing plant to a heavily guarded storage depot.

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Laws/68-100#Description": "Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/1-33#Description": "The Exodus was a tipping point. The gods offered no help to the billions who died in the cataclysm, and spirituality has little meaning in the Forge. Most now see religion as a useless relic of our past. But the search for meaning continues, and many are all-too-willing to follow a charismatic leader who claims to offer a better way.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/1-33#Quest_Starter": "A charismatic leader claims to have harnessed a technology that offers new hope to the people of the Forge. What is this innovation? What is your relationship to this person or their followers? What grave danger do they pose?",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/34-67#Result": "Our faith is as diverse as our people.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/34-67#Description": "Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/34-67#Quest_Starter": "A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold a Primordial artifact. What holy object do they seek? Why are you sworn to stop them?",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/68-100#Result": "Three dominant religious orders, the Triumvirate, battle for influence and power within the Forge.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Religion/68-100#Description": "Our communities are often sworn to serve one of the three doctrines of the Triumvirate. For many, faith offers purpose and meaning. But it also divides us. Throughout our brief history in the Forge, the leaders of the Triumvirate have pitted us against one another. For this reason, some are apostates who disavow these religions and follow a different path.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Magic/1-33#Description": "Some look to superstition and age-old traditions for comfort in this unforgiving galaxy. But that is foolishness. What some call magic is simply a product of technologies or natural forces we aren’t yet equipped to understand.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Magic/34-67#Result": "Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we call paragons.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Magic/34-67#Description": "While not magic in the truest sense, the abilities of the paragons are as close to magic as we can conjure.\n\nThese powers are born of:",

They are also hunted by a person or organization who seeks to use them as a weapon. Why are you sworn to protect the paragon? What fabled location might offer a new home for them?",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Magic/68-100#Result": "Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin.",

Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Communication_and_Data/1-33#Description": "The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously guarded. Ships and outposts endure prolonged periods of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain advantage or undermine foes.",
  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Communication_and_Data/1-33#Quest_Starter": "An insurgent faction seeks to make knowledge available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What information is held there? Why is it also important to you?",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Communication_and_Data/34-67#Description": "Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.",

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/Communication_and_Data/68-100#Description": "Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon.

  "Starforged/Setting_Truths/War/34-67#Description": "Mercenary guilds wield power in the Forge. Some are scrappy outfits of no more than a dozen soldiers.
